### üìå Background
Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite *Trypanosoma cruzi*, remains a major public health concern in Latin America, with no licensed vaccine available. Identifying **correlates of protection (CoPs)** ‚Äî measurable immune parameters that predict vaccine efficacy ‚Äî can accelerate vaccine development. While most known CoPs are antibody-based, they have not been validated in *T. cruzi* vaccine research. This work explores the use of **cellular immune biomarkers** as alternative CoPs.

### üß™ Study Overview
- **Experimental model**: Mice immunized with a trans-sialidase (TSf)-based vaccine candidate, potentiated with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) to deplete myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).
- **Biomarker acquisition**: Percentages of CD4‚Å∫, CD8‚Å∫, and CD11b‚Å∫Gr-1‚Å∫ cells measured by flow cytometry from peripheral blood.
- **Outcome**: Survival at day 25 post-*T. cruzi* challenge.
- **Analysis approach**: Machine Learning (ML) with Decision Tree models to identify and evaluate potential CoPs.

### üìä Study Workflow

![Workflow Figure](images/figure_workflow.png)

**Workflow including experimental timeline, dataset construction, and machine learning analysis.**  
The study can be divided into three steps:  
A) **Experimental timeline** ‚Äì Female BALB/c mice were assigned to control (PBS) or vaccinated (double 5FU TSf‚ÄêISPA) groups. The vaccinated group received three subcutaneous doses of TSf‚ÄêISPA (on days 0, 15, and 30), each preceded and followed by intraperitoneal 5FU administration to reduce MDSC expansion. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood was performed 48 hours after the final TSf‚ÄêISPA dose. All groups were intraperitoneally infected with 1600‚Äì1700 Tulahuen strain trypomastigotes. Survival was recorded until day 35 p.i. The experiment was repeated three times to collect a sufficient number of animals.  
B) **Dataset construction** ‚Äì Flow cytometry data and corresponding survival outcomes for each mouse at day 25 p.i. were compiled into a dataset combining the three assays performed.  
C) **Machine learning analysis** ‚Äì The dataset was used to train and test a Decision Tree classification model to identify potential CoPs associated with survival.

### üîç Main Findings
- Individual biomarkers showed limited predictive power.
- **Biomarker engineering** combining effector and regulatory arms of the immune response improved prediction:
  - **REB** = (%CD8‚Å∫ + %CD4‚Å∫) ‚àí %CD11b‚Å∫Gr-1‚Å∫
  - **pICoP** (Potential Integrative CoP) = 2 √ó %CD8‚Å∫ + %CD4‚Å∫ ‚àí %CD11b‚Å∫Gr-1‚Å∫
- The pICoP significantly enhanced a simple one-level Decision Tree‚Äôs predictive performance:
  - **Accuracy**: ~0.86
  - **AUC-ROC**: ~0.87

### üíª Repository Code Structure

This repository includes two main Python scripts and one Jupyter Notebook, each with specific roles in the analysis workflow:

- **`notebook_CoPs_ML.ipynb`**  
  The notebook orchestrates the overall analysis by loading the processed data, invoking the model defined in `biomarker_decision_tree.py`, and running the evaluation workflow. It generates visualizations and summarizes results in an accessible and reproducible format. Ensure that `biomarker_decision_tree.py` is located in the same directory or accessible in the Python path for proper import.

- **`biomarker_decision_tree.py`**  
  This script defines the `BiomarkerDecisionTree` class, encapsulating the machine learning pipeline for training, validating, and evaluating Decision Tree models. It includes the implementation of repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation (5 folds, 100 repetitions with different random seeds), metric calculations (Accuracy, AUC-ROC, F1-score, Precision, Recall), and performance aggregation. The encapsulation facilitates code reuse and modular analysis.
  
- **`pICoP_search.py`**  
  This script implements a systematic computational search to identify the optimal weighted linear combination of cellular immune biomarkers (%CD8‚Å∫, %CD4‚Å∫, and %CD11b‚Å∫Gr-1‚Å∫ MDSC-like cells). It exhaustively evaluates all possible weight combinations within a specified range using a simple decision stump model. The resulting composite biomarker, named **pICoP** (2 √ó %CD8‚Å∫ + %CD4‚Å∫ ‚àí %CD11b‚Å∫Gr-1‚Å∫), was selected for its superior predictive performance (high F1-Score and AUC-ROC), simplicity, and statistical significance confirmed by a permutation test (p < 0.05). This approach validates the initial biologically driven design.

### üßÆ Machine Learning Workflow: Decision Tree with Repeated Stratified k-Fold Cross-Validation

The analysis implemented in this repository follows a **nested repetition‚Äìfold structure** to ensure robust performance estimation and minimize variance due to random data partitioning.

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Feature and target definition**  
   The model uses selected biomarker variables (e.g., %CD4‚Å∫, %CD8‚Å∫, %CD11b‚Å∫Gr-1‚Å∫, engineered biomarker like pICoP) as features (**X**) and survival status at day 25 p.i. as the target (**y**).

2. **Outer loop: Seed iterations**  
   - The procedure is repeated for a specified number of random seeds (e.g., 100 iterations).  
   - Each seed defines a unique random split pattern for the cross-validation folds.

3. **Inner loop: Stratified k-Fold cross-validation**  
   - For each seed, a **StratifiedKFold** split is performed (e.g., 5 folds) to preserve the class distribution in each fold.  
   - The model is trained and evaluated **k** times per seed, each time using a different fold as the test set.

4. **Model training and prediction per fold**  
   - A **Decision Tree Classifier** with `max_depth=1` (decision stump) and `class_weight='balanced'` is trained on the training set.  
   - Predictions (class labels and probabilities) are generated for both the training and test sets.

5. **Metric computation per fold**  
   For each fold, the following metrics are calculated **per class** and stored:
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-score for class 0 and class 1.
   - Accuracy.
   - Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).  
   Confusion matrices are also aggregated per seed.

6. **Per-seed averaging**  
   - Metrics from the **k folds** are averaged to obtain a **single performance value per metric for that seed**.  
   - Confusion matrices are normalized across folds.

7. **Global aggregation**  
   - After all seeds are processed, the global performance distribution for each metric is obtained (one value per seed).  
   - Metrics can then be summarized as:
     - **Mean ¬± standard deviation** across seeds.
     - **95% confidence intervals** using bootstrap resampling.

**Advantages of this approach:**
- Reduces overfitting risk by repeatedly evaluating on unseen data.
- Produces **stable performance estimates** less dependent on a single split.
- Allows for **statistical characterization** of metric variability.
