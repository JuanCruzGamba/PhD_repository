# 🧬 PhD Research Repository | Machine Learning & Immunology
This repository contains the code and data developed during my PhD research in Biological Sciences at FBCB-UNL, focused on the analysis of immunological data and the development of machine learning models to uncover predictive patterns in biological systems.

Here you will find code implemented in the publications related to my research, as well as additional analyses and exploratory work carried out during my doctoral studies. My work involves biological data exploration, predictive modeling, and the integration of computational and experimental approaches to better understand immune responses.

Research Focus:

- Analysis of immunological and biological data to develop predictive machine learning models.
- Integration of experimental and computational approaches for biological data interpretation.
- Application of data science, statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence to biological systems.
- Implementation of Python-based analytical pipelines, using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
